# To Run:
To run the program, clone the repo and navigate to the folder BroadChallenge. Once there, type `python main.py` to run the file. If you want to use anMBTA API key, the program looks for the key stored in the environment variable `MBTA_KEY`. If there is nothing stored in that variable, no API key will be used, but the code will still run. 

To run unit tests, run `python tests.py`. 

Tested on Linux, should work anywhere.
